# Nori_Based_Path_Tracer

 A path tracer developed based on Nori 

    * Sphere class, ray-sphere intersection
    * Directional light
    * Diffuse shading with hard shadows
    * Anti-aliasing with super sampling
    * Monte Carlo integrator
    * Implicit path tracing with biased path-length termination
    * Explicit path tracing with Russian roulette
